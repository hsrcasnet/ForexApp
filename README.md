# ForexApp
During the 2017/18 CAS .NET Xamarin Mobile App Development course at HSR, students were asked to develop a Xamarin Forms based mobile app which retrieves, processes and displays data of any kind. Some of us decided to develop a fictional foreign exchange app to display market data of selected currency pairs (e.g. "CHFUSD" or "USDCHF").

This project exercises the following patterns and features:
- XAML UI
- MVVM Data Binding
- Value Converters
- IoC
- Plugins for Xamarin
- Styles
